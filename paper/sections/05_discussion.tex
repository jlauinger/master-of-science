\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threatsToValidity}

%Since we showed actual exploit vectors and bugs with code snippets that are commonly used in popular real-world applications, we think that research on \unsafe{} is clearly not only an academic issue, but has direct and important consequences on the actual software market.
%Audit efforts should be made up to an import depth of around 4.


Potential internal threats to validity for our study include bias towards bigger projects because those might be over-represented in the manually labeled data set. 
External threats include a bias towards more active projects with many developers because we selected a subset of the most-starred open-source projects on GitHub. 
Also we only considered projects that use the Go module system and about a third of the top 500 projects are not covered by the analysis yet.
Further, we could have missed projects from a special domain not having that many stars which might have other usage scenarios for \unsafe{} Go.
Nevertheless, one can argue that the biggest projects also have professional developers, higher standards and code gets more reviewed, thus, code quality should be higher.
