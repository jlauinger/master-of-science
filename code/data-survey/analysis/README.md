# Data analysis notebooks

These are Jupyter Notebooks that I used for data analysis and plot creation. There are lots of those notebooks, some of
which were for temporary exploration. The most important notebooks are the following:

 - `costa-comparison.ipynb` contains the comparison steps when reconstructing the Costa et al. related work study
 - `go-safer-evaluation.ipynb` contains code to evaluate `go-safer`, such as calculations of precision and recall
 - `linters-comparison.ipynb` contains code to compare the `go-geiger` performance to go vet and gosec
 - `figures-paper.ipynb` contains code to generate plots and tables used in the paper
 - `figures-thesis.ipynb` contains code to generate plots and tables used in the thesis
