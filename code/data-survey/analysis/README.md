# Data analysis notebooks

These are Jupyter Notebooks that I used for data analysis and plot creation. There are lots of those notebooks, some of
which were for temporary exploration. The most important notebooks are the following:

 - `table-formatting.ipynb` contains code to generate tables used in the thesis
 - `figure-formatting.ipynb` contains code to generate plots used in the thesis
 - `paper-figures.ipynb` contains code to generate plots and tables used in the paper
 - `costa-comparison.ipynb` contains the comparison steps when reconstructing the Costa et al. related work study
 - `go-safer-evaluation.ipynb` contains code to evaluate `go-safer`, such as calculations of precision and recall
