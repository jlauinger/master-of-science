# Study data

This directory contains most of my empirical study data. It is organized like this:

 - `archive/` contains CSV files with code snippets that were useful as intermediate steps at some time, but do not have
   a concrete contribution now
 - `ast/` contains output data from the abstract syntax tree analysis step of my data acquisition tool. It is used to see
   if unsafe usages are correlated locally within functions or statements
 - `classification/` contains all CSV files that are seen by and usable with my code snippet classification tool. It is
   now an empty stub directory because classification has been completed
 - `figures/` contains figure output files such as PDF graphics, generated by the analysis notebooks
 - `geiger/` contains output data form the `go-geiger` analysis step of my data acquisition tool. It is the main data
   source for my quantitative analysis
 - `labeled-dataset/` contains my data set of 1,400 open-source Go code snippets with labels on unsafe usage and purpose
 - `linters/` contains output data from my data acquisition tool, generated by the analysis steps involving external
   programs such as Grep, go vet, gosec or go-safer.
 - `packages_0_499.csv` contains information about all analyzed packages
 - `projects.csv` contains information about all analyzed projects

All data is provided in machine-readable CSV format, except the labeled dataset which is additionally provided as a
directory structure with one file for each snippet, as generated by my dumper script contained in this repository.
