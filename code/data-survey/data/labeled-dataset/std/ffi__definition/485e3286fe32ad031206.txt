// needm is called when a cgo callback happens on a
// thread without an m (a thread not created by Go).
// In this case, needm is expected to find an m to use
// and return with m, g initialized correctly.
// Since m and g are not set now (likely nil, but see below)
// needm is limited in what routines it can call. In particular
// it can only call nosplit functions (textflag 7) and cannot
// do any scheduling that requires an m.
//
// In order to avoid needing heavy lifting here, we adopt
// the following strategy: there is a stack of available m's
// that can be stolen. Using compare-and-swap
// to pop from the stack has ABA races, so we simulate
// a lock by doing an exchange (via Casuintptr) to steal the stack
// head and replace the top pointer with MLOCKED (1).
// This serves as a simple spin lock that we can use even
// without an m. The thread that locks the stack in this way
// unlocks the stack by storing a valid stack head pointer.
//
// In order to make sure that there is always an m structure
// available to be stolen, we maintain the invariant that there
// is always one more than needed. At the beginning of the
// program (if cgo is in use) the list is seeded with a single m.
// If needm finds that it has taken the last m off the list, its job
// is - once it has installed its own m so that it can do things like
// allocate memory - to create a spare m and put it on the list.
//
// Each of these extra m's also has a g0 and a curg that are
// pressed into service as the scheduling stack and current
// goroutine for the duration of the cgo callback.
//
// When the callback is done with the m, it calls dropm to
// put the m back on the list.
