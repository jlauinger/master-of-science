// This implements the write barrier buffer. The write barrier itself
// is gcWriteBarrier and is implemented in assembly.
//
// See mbarrier.go for algorithmic details on the write barrier. This
// file deals only with the buffer.
//
// The write barrier has a fast path and a slow path. The fast path
// simply enqueues to a per-P write barrier buffer. It's written in
// assembly and doesn't clobber any general purpose registers, so it
// doesn't have the usual overheads of a Go call.
//
// When the buffer fills up, the write barrier invokes the slow path
// (wbBufFlush) to flush the buffer to the GC work queues. In this
// path, since the compiler didn't spill registers, we spill *all*
// registers and disallow any GC safe points that could observe the
// stack frame (since we don't know the types of the spilled
// registers).
