The Go programming language, although aiming to provide memory and thread safety through a strict type system enforced at compile-time, also offers ways to circumvent this safety net through using the unsafe package.
It allows arbitrary type casts and pointer arithmetic.
There are legitimate use cases, e.g. low-level memory operations needed in the Go runtime, or increased efficiency due to avoiding unnecessary allocations.
However, such uses must be done with caution to avoid introducing vulnerabilities common to C programs, like buffer overflows and use-after-free.
In this work, we contribute a large-scale quantitative study on the usage of unsafe in the \projsAnalyzed{} most popular Go projects on GitHub, including an analysis of \checkNum{1,400} code samples on how unsafe is used and for what purpose.
We find that \checkNum{5.5\%} of packages used transitively by the projects contain unsafe usages, and \checkNum{38 \%} of projects contain at least one usage that is not part of the standard library.
Based on the usage patterns found, we present dangers and possible exploit vectors.
Finally, we present two novel tools for Go developers: \toolUsage{} to count unsafe usages in a package and its dependencies, and \toolSA{} to identify dangerous usage patterns that were previously undetected by existing tools.
