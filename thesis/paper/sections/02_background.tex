Paragraph about memory vulnerability patterns and countermeasures in "safe" languages, such as Go.

\subsection{Unsafe Go}

Ways to tell the compiler to ignore the safety net and do what potentially unsafe operations.

Description of \textit{unsafe} stdlib package, and especially \textit{unsafe.Pointer}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item cast any pointer to unsafe.Pointer
    \item cast unsafe.Pointer to any pointer
    \item cast unsafe.Pointer to uintptr
    \item cast uintptr to unsafe.Pointer
\end{itemize}

The first two give arbitrary casts, and the other two give pointer arithmetics.

Example, buggy and unsafe, code snippet to cast a slice in-place:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Golang, label=lst:unsafe-example, caption=Example buggy unsafe Go code]
func ToBytes(s string) []byte {
    strHeader := (*reflect.StringHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(&s))
    return *(*[]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&reflect.SliceHeader{
        Data: strHeader.Data,
        Cap:  strHeader.Len,
        Len:  strHeader.Len,
    }))
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Go Dependency Management}

Old way: packages, Go Path

New way: modules, registries, \textit{go.mod} file.

Package cache, versions, bad reproducibility, relatively high error rates for dependency resolution.
