\chapter{Go Open-Source Projects Under Analysis}\label{ch:app:projects}

To compile a suitable set of open-source Go projects that should be analyzed in this thesis, I searched on Github for
projects that use Go as their language, sorted by stars, and selected the top 500 most-starred projects.
For reference, here is an index of the projects I downloaded and analyzed.
