Cargo Geiger is the template for the Go dependency check tool.
It does the same thing for the Rust programming language.

\section{OWASP Dependency Checker}\label{sec:owasp-dependency-checker}

Explain OWASP security project.

Show OWASP Dependency Checker program, show experimental Go extension for it.
This tool does no unsafe code analysis though, it checks for known vulnerabilities of the dependencies in the
OWASP database.

\subsection{Understanding Memory and Thread Safety Practices and Issues in Real-World Rust Programs}
\label{subsec:understanding-memory-and-thread-safety-practices-and-issues-in-real-world-rust-programs}

Qin et al.~\cite{qin2020} contribute the first to their knowledge empirical study of bugs related to unsafe code blocks
in Rust.
They mention other empirical studies~\cite{difranco2017, lu2013, chou2001, leesatapornwongsa2016, jin2012, gunawi2014, gu2015}
none of which seem to be related to Rust or Go.
The authors analyze 5 projects, 5 libraries and 2 databases.
They randomly sample 850 unsafe usages out of those.
They analyze the usages, categorize them into classes, analyze the impact of the bugs and develop two new static code
checking tools.
In essence, this is exactly my thesis but done for Rust, and it's probably an excellent example of how to structure a
paper on this.

A main difference to this thesis is that the authors not only look into the current revision code, but explicitly look
through the Git history, filtering for commits that remove unsafe usages.
They further go through reported bugs on the software under analysis and look into the code how those bugs were fixed.
Bug data is retrieved from CVE and RustSec.
This is something I should probably do as well!

Within the 850 unsafe usages, the authors analyze 70 memory-safety issues and 100 concurrency bugs.
It sounds like they found all of those, but this high number is because they look at real-world bugs that were previously
reported.
Using their tools however, they also find about 5 to 10 new bugs that they disclosed to the developers.

Similar to my thesis, they explain the purpose of safe code and reasons why unsafe code might be needed.
They obviously focus on Rust, but some of the points will apply to Go as well.

The reasons to use unsafe code are clustered into these groups: Reuse existing code, convert C-array to Rust slice,
improve performance.
The authors find that often the use of unsafe code has good or unavoidable reasons.
Looking at the commit diffs, they find that unsafe code gets removed to fix memory safety, improve code structure,
improve thread safety, fix bugs, or because it was unnecessary in the first place.

The authors also look into the Rust standard library, which has similar uses of unsafe as the Go standard library.
Unsafe code often requires some preconditions on lifetime or input data to hold, and this can be achieved by encapsulating
it into an interior unsafe function that checks these conditions and might skip the unsafe code if they do not hold.

The areas of problems identified are buffer overflows, null-pointer dereferencing, reading uninitialized memory, invalid
free, use after free, and double free.
Fixing strategies were conditionally skipping the unsafe code, adjusting variable lifetime, or changing unsafe operands.

Rust also has thread safety problems, and problems the authors identified can be grouped into blocking and non-blocking.
Blocking bugs are caused due to incorrect scoping of auto-releasing mutexes.
Channels might also block.
Non-blocking bugs include data races and stem from incorrect scoping of shared data or confused ownership.

If a function's safety depends on how it is used, it might be better put into an encapsulation.

The authors suggest development of IDE extension visualizing scopes and lifetimes, development of Rust-tailored static
analysis tools (which they already contributed two), and dynamic analysis tools.
Due to the study language developers can also learn from design issues concerning the Rust language itself, because it
shows how developers adapt to new language concepts over time.

\subsection{Is Rust Used Safely by Software Developers?}
\label{subsec:is-rust-used-safely-by-software-developers?}

Evens et al.~\cite{evans2020} present an empirical study of unsafe usages in Rust crates.
They only include statistical facts such as total number of unsage usages.
This is different from Qin et al.~\cite{qin2020} in that they did not do an in-depth analysis of potential bugs.
Still they got accepted at ICSE!

They found that most unsafe usage is to call other unsafe Rust code, while calling C code is less of a concern.
About a third of libraries contain unsafe code and more than half of them transitively do through dependencies.
The usage count in crates did not change much over the course of 10 months work.
More popular libraries are more likely to contain more unsafe code because they encapsulate more popular C libraries.

The authors conducted a N=20 survey on Reddit, revealing that 10\% of developers used unsafe to make the code compile.
Other popular reasons included performance optimizations, advanced data structures, and unsafe code offering a slicker
and "more elegant" interface.
Most developers employed more testing, static and dynamic analysis, and fuzzing when using unsafe code, but many also
said they would "look carefully on the code".
I'd suspect this is not an effective approach.

The authors developed an augmented Rust CFG and algorithm to detect potentially unsafe functions in all Rust crates that
would compile.
