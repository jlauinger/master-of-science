\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

In today's modern society, software has become an integral part of many industries and areas of life.
The security of that software is very important, because successful attacks on it can have serious implications,
especially in the case of critical infrastructures like energy and food supply chains or medical services.
Programming languages provide concepts to help avoiding many security problems, but they can not completely prevent
them from being introduced.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

Modern programming languages like Rust and Go have mechanisms to protect potential
unsafe usages, e.g., dereferences of raw pointers or modifying static variables. Thus, it is
recommended to avoid unsafe usages. However, if a developer wants to avoid unsafe
usages and potential security vulnerabilities caused by these usages, they do not only need
to check their code but also their dependencies.

To provide a developer the power to understand the unsafe usages within their code base,
tools like cargo-geiger~\cite{cargogeiger} exists. Unfortunately, such a tool does not exist by today for Go.
Thus, an in-depth analysis of how many Go projects include direct and indirect unsafe
usages and if these projects are vulnerable does not exist, e.g., to buffer overflows~\cite{larochelle2001, alnaeli2017, wang2020}.
Within this work, the aim is to develop a tool, probably based on go vet~\cite{govet}, that can identify
unsafe usages in Go projects - similar to cargo-geiger. Based on this tool, the thesis should
evaluate how common unsafe usages in Go are and try to analyze if vulnerabilities caused
by unsafe usages exist.

\section{Contributions}\label{sec:contributions}

This section presents the main contributions that I make in this thesis. They are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A thorough analysis of problems and consequences of \unsafe{} API usage patterns in Go code with respect to a
    security context,

    \item \toolGeiger, an open-source static analysis tool to identify and count \unsafe{} usages in Go packages
    including its dependencies,

    \item an empirical study of \unsafe{} code usage in the \projsTotal{} most popular open-source Go projects on
    \github{}, including the identification of \checkNum{three} main areas of danger and an in-depth study of
    \numberLabeledCodeSnippets{} code samples used in \projsForLabeledCodeSnippets{} selected projects, yielding a
    two-dimensional manual classification of usages and valuable insight into how and for what purpose unsafe code is
    used in Go applications,

    \item \toolSafer{}, an open-source, \toolVet{}-style, linter tool to find \checkNum{two} \unsafe{} usage patterns
    that were previously uncaught with existing tools, including an evaluation of its performance,

    \item the submission of \numberPRs{} pull requests with fixes to \numberBugsFixed{} previously vulnerable code
    snippets in open-source Go libraries, \numberPRsMerged{} of which have been merged by the authors so far, and

    \item a replication of a related study on \unsafe{} Go code in concurrent work by Costa et al.~\cite{costa2020},
    including a comparison to my work and discussion of differences.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Outline}\label{sec:outline}

This thesis is structured as follows: Chapter~\ref{ch:background} gives background information on the memory safety
and the Go \unsafe{} API, as well as the dependency management system used in Go.
Chapter~\ref{ch:unsafe-security-problems} analyzes and discusses possible vulnerabilities caused by \unsafe{} code
usages which can be found in real-world application code.
Chapter~\ref{ch:go-geiger} presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of \toolGeiger, a novel static analysis
tool which finds \unsafe{} usages in a Go package as well as its dependencies.
The chapter also contains the study methodology and results for analyzing the top \projsTotal{} most popular open-source
Go projects, and the labeled data set of \numberLabeledCodeSnippets{} code samples.
Chapter~\ref{ch:go-safer} shows the design, implementation, and evaluation of \toolSafer, the novel linter tool that
can identify two dangerous and common \unsafe{} usage patterns.
Chapter~\ref{ch:related-work} discusses related and concurrent work, including the replication of and comparison to a
similar study on \unsafe{} usage in Go by Costa et al.~\cite{costa2020}.
Chapter~\ref{ch:discussion} puts the findings and results of this work in context.
Threats to validity and future work are also presented here.
Finally, chapter 8 concludes the work.
