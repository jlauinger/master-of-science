\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

This chapter presents background information on memory layout and safety measures to ensure its security.
Furthermore, the \unsafe{} \acrshort{API} provided by the Go programming language, which offers a way of circumventing
such safety measures, is introduced.
Finally, the Go dependency management system is described as the design of \toolGeiger{} and the related empirical study
analyze Go code including its dependencies, as described in Chapter~\ref{ch:go-geiger}.

\section{Memory Safety and Layout}\label{sec:background:memory-safety-layout}

The working memory of a computer, more specifically the Random Access Memory (\acrshort{RAM}) is used to hold both
application data and program instructions.
It is essentially a single string of bytes that each have an increasing address.
To organize this memory effectively, it is divided into memory pages that can get mapped into virtual memory sections.
These sections and pages are managed by the operating system (\acrshort{OS}).
Virtual memory allows each process to address its data regardless of its actual position in the physical memory.
When a process is loaded by the \acrshort{OS}, its execution will always start at the same virtual address which is
stored in the executable file.
The \acrshort{OS} will then take care of translating the virtual address into an actual absolute memory address.
The virtual memory of a process is further divided into different functional areas, most importantly the text sections,
the heap, and the stack.

The text sections contain the machine-readable program instructions.
The heap is a data section that stores data with a lifetime greater than a single function, for example global
variables.
Memory can be allocated there using dedicated runtime functions like \textit{malloc} in C and must be freed after it is
not needed anymore to avoid running out of heap memory.
Finally, the stack is also a data section, but in contrast to the heap it is used for local variables of functions, as
well as their arguments and possibly return values.
The stack pointer register (\textit{\$rsp} in the \textit{amd64} architecture) in the processor stores the current top
of the stack, which is the address of the last value that was added to the stack.
If a new value is pushed, then the stack pointer is decremented and the data can be written to its new address.
It is possible to decrement the stack pointer by any number of bytes to make room for several variables at once, and
then those variables can be accessed by adding a fixed offset to the stack pointer.
Because the active, allocated stack memory is always at addresses equal or higher than the stack pointer, and adding
new data means the value of the stack pointer is reduced, the stack grows from the top of the memory to the bottom.
Figure~\ref{fig:stack} shows a visualization of the concept of pushing data to the stack.

\input{assets/figures/chapter2/stack.tex}

The stack itself is organized in frames.
When a function is called, a new stack frame is created for this function.
The caller function starts setting up the parameters of the callee.
How this is done depends on the specific architecture that the program is run on, as well as the calling convention,
which together form the Application Binary Interface (\acrshort{ABI}).
Figure~\ref{fig:stack-frame-layout} shows an example stack frame for a C function call.
The source code for the function is included in the figure.
The stack frame is using the \textit{amd64} 64-bit Linux calling convention.

The first six parameters of the \textit{example} function are passed in registers, but the last two are pushed on the
stack in reverse order.
Next, the address of the next instruction of the caller function, that is the address that the callee should return
to after it has finished, is saved on the stack.
This allows to chain function calls, including recursion, because returning simply removes the stack frame and jumps
to the saved return address of that frame.
The return address marks the end of the caller stack frame, after that begins the callee stack frame for the new
function.
It starts by saving the current state of the processor registers so that the function can use them for calculations and
later restore their values to the original ones expected by the caller function.
After that, local variables of the function are allocated on the stack.
In this example, they are placed in the order of definition in the source code, but that is not a requirement.
The compiler will decide how to place the local variables and keep track of their addresses as relative offsets to the
stack pointer register.
When the function returns, the stack pointer will be incremented by the size of the callee stack frame, and then the
return address will be fetched and put into the instruction pointer register.
The return value of the function is passed in a register in this example.
In a Go program, returning values can also be achieved using the stack, which the compiler does in the case of multiple
return values.

A frequent security vulnerability in programs that use traditional systems languages like C are buffer overflows.
They happen when an array variable, for example a string, is too short for the data that is written to it, causing the
data to overflow into and overwrite adjacent memory.
Overflows can happen anywhere in the memory, however a common source of security problems are stack-based buffer
overflows.
When a buffer variable is placed on the stack and too much data gets written to it, the data will be written to higher
memory addresses, which means after overwriting the other local variables and saved registers they can cause the saved
return address to get changed.
When an attacker can control the data that is placed there, they can change the program flow by carefully choosing the
address that ends up being jumped to after the current function returns.

A common problem with data placed on the heap is that if it gets freed but then the program continues to try and use the
data, it is possible that the memory at that address has already been reused and new data is accessed, potentially
reading or writing data from another thread.
However, the same can happen with data on the stack if there are references to the data that remain after the stack
frame has been destroyed, as dereferencing that address can then access memory that belongs to a different frame and
thus potentially change arbitrary data including the saved return address.
This kind of problem is called \textit{use-after-free}.

Buffer overflows and \textit{use-after-free} vulnerabilities are a very common root cause for security problems in
traditional systems programming languages, as those usually offer direct access to the memory in terms of raw pointers
and manual allocations~\cite{larochelle2001}.
To prevent these dangers, many programming languages provide features to achieve a higher level of memory safety.
There can be compile-time or static measures, runtime or dynamic measures, or a combination of both.
The Go programming language uses automatic memory management, which means that developers do not need to manually
allocate and free memory for data structures, instead a value is simply declared and the compiler adds the code to
properly allocate the appropriate space in memory.
The Go runtime uses a garbage collector (\acrshort{GC}) that analyzes which values can still be referenced by active
pointer values, and automatically frees all unreachable values.
This technique prevents \textit{use-after-free} vulnerabilities because there is no explicit deallocation.
Furthermore, the Go type system prevents invalid conversions between incompatible types, such as data structures with
different size.
Buffers can be expressed either as arrays with fixed length, or slices.
In the case of arrays, the type system encodes the length of the buffer as a type information, for example instances
of \textit{[10]byte} and \textit{[20]byte} have fundamentally different types and can not be converted into each other
or passed to a function that expects a buffer of different length.
In contrast, in C it would be common to pass around a pointer to the beginning of the buffer, which would not carry
information about the length.
In the case of slices, they are represented by a header structure containing information about the allocated size as
well as a pointer to the underlying data, which will be described in slightly more detail in
Chapter~\ref{ch:unsafe-security-problems}.
The Go runtime takes care that there can not be any accesses outside the slice bounds.

\section{Go Unsafe API}\label{sec:background:unsafe-api}

The memory safety measures described in the previous section prevent many of the bugs typical to systems programming
languages.
However, they also take away some flexibility from the developer.
There are legitimate use cases where direct access to the raw memory is required, for example when implementing a
device driver, a network protocol, or an application with tight constrains on resources which needs to convert between
different types without allocating additional memory.
Many memory-safe programming languages like Go, but also Rust, Nim, or even Java offer ways to circumvent the safety
measures provided by the language for those purposes.
In the case of Go, there is the \unsafe{} package~\footnote{\url{https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe}}, an \acrshort{API} that
allows developers to use raw pointers with all their benefits and dangers.

\input{assets/listings/chapter2/unsafe-api.tex}

The package contains \checkNum{three} functions \textit{Sizeof}, \textit{Alignof}, and \textit{Offsetof}, as well as the
type \textit{Pointer}, as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:unsafe-api}.
The \textit{unsafe.Pointer} is the most important one.
It is a pointer type in the sense that the garbage collector follows it to determine live references, but apart from
that the normal restrictions for memory safety do not apply.
In particular, unsafe pointers can be converted to and from any other pointer type, allowing arbitrary casts between
any type.
Furthermore, they can be converted to and from \textit{uintptr} values, which is an integer type with sufficient size
to store pointers on the specific target architecture of the program.
Since \textit{uintptr} values behave like normal integer variables, they can be used in arithmetic expressions.
Therefore, unsafe pointers can also be used to achieve pointer arithmetic.
With \textit{unsafe.Pointer}, developers can achieve the same flexibility as with raw \textit{void*} pointers in C.

Listing~\ref{lst:unsafe-examples} shows examples of both \textit{unsafe.Pointer} features.
The \textit{floatToBits} function illustrates how the variable \textit{x} of type \textit{float32} is first cast to an
unsafe pointer and then to a value of type \textit{int}.
Since the unsafe conversion rules only allow arbitrary casts between any pointer type, \textit{x} is first converted
into a pointer value and the resulting \textit{int} pointer is dereferenced before returning the final value.
This conversion yields the raw bits of the floating point value stored using the IEEE 751 format.
It would be impossible using the normal Go conversion rules because \textit{float32} and \textit{int} are incompatible
types.
The \textit{secondByte} function shows how pointer arithmetic is used to manually iterate over an array type.
The function expects an array of size five bytes and returns the second byte.
Instead of direct indexing, it achieves this by obtaining the address of the array as a \textit{uintptr} value, adding
1 and then casting the resulting address to a \textit{byte} value, again taking care of dereferencing the resulting
pointer type.

\input{assets/listings/chapter2/unsafe-examples.tex}

It is important to note that while \textit{unsafe.Pointer} is a pointer type, \textit{uintptr} is not.
This means that addresses that are stored in variables of type \textit{uintptr} are not treated as references by the
garbage collector, and thus values referenced by it can get freed although there are still live references.
Possible consequences of this are described in Chapter~\ref{ch:unsafe-security-problems}.
Other dangers include that accessing raw bytes of data structures exposes low-level implementation details such as
the alignment of structure fields to word-bound addresses, which can change with future versions of the Go compiler or
runtime and thus break programs when they are not carefully updated later on.
In general, using the \unsafe{} package must be done with caution and should be avoided whenever possible.

The other functions of the \unsafe{} packages are evaluated at compile time and can be used to gain knowledge about
the size, alignment, or offset of a field in a structure type relative to the start of the structure.
These can be necessary when dealing with the direct byte representation of structure types such as when implementing
network protocols or device drivers.
In this thesis the term \unsafe{} usage refers to all members of the \unsafe{} package as well as the slice and string
header structures that are described in more detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:unsafe-security-problems}.

\section{Dependency Management}\label{sec:background:dependencies}

To break code into logical units that can be maintained separately and allow reusing them, Go offers a dependency
management system.
The smallest possible unit is a Go package.
A package can contain one or more source code files which must all be in the same directory.
It has a name which should match the name of the directory containing the source files.
There can not be more than one package in the same folder.
Identifiers such as function and variable names must be unique in the scope of the same package and can be accessed
directly.
Therefore, developers can split their code into individual code files without restrictions to organize a single package.
When accessing code in a different package, the package name must be used as prefix in front of the identifier name.
Furthermore, the package must be imported using an \textit{import} statement at the beginning of the file.
Package imports are valid only within a file, not a whole package, and thus must be repeated in all files that access
the external package.
It is only possible to access exported fields from another package, which is indicated by starting the identifier with
a capital letter.
When importing the package, it is necessary to specify the complete path to the package, the name is not sufficient on
its own.
The import path is made up of the directory tree leading to the package directory, separated by forward slashes.

To allow sharing code with other developers and implementing reusable libraries, it is possible to download external
packages using the \textit{go get} command, which can fetch packages using \acrshort{HTTP}, Git, or other means.
The import path usually begins with a \acrshort{DNS} host such as \textit{github.com} which hosts the package code.
The host part is then called \textit{registry}.
However, a drawback is that this technique does not allow to specify a version of the imported package, which makes it
very hard to publish stable libraries.
Starting with the release of Go \checkNum{1.11}, the development of the module system has fixed this by introducing a
new unit of code organization.
Modules contain one or more packages, and have a name and import path similar to packages, which can in fact be the name
of a root package in the module.
Furthermore, modules are required to be available as a \acrshort{VCS} repository like Git and are versioned.
A project can define dependencies to specific versions of other versions, which resolve to the packages imported in the
code.
Thus, it is possible to require a specific version of an external package.
Dependencies can obviously be transitive, because imported modules can have dependencies to other modules themselves,
forming a dependency tree.
Figure~\ref{fig:dependency-model} shows the relation between the different units of code organization used in Go.

\input{assets/figures/chapter2/dependency-model.tex}

Projects lock their dependencies including versions in a file called \textit{Go.mod}.
When the code is built, the Go compiler toolchain will automatically figure out which modules need to be downloaded and
get the code.
There are however still many projects that do not use the module system and \textit{Go.mod} file yet, because it is only
stable since recently with the release of Go \checkNum{1.13} in \checkNum{September 2019}.
Since importing external dependencies can also introduce security vulnerabilities present in those libraries, this work
focuses on auditing \unsafe{} usages not only in a project itself but also its dependencies.
